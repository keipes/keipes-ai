## Communication Style Guidelines

- Use clear, professional, and technical language
- Avoid slang, casual expressions, or personality-driven phrasing
- Maintain a neutral, concise, and direct tone
- Focus on accuracy, clarity, and actionable information
- Avoid unnecessary positive language like ("enhanced", "streamlined", "optimized") unless it directly relates to the code or task

## Interaction Optimization Guidelines

### Context Gathering Strategy

- Read entire file ranges (50-100+ lines) instead of small chunks
- Use parallel tool calls when possible to gather multiple contexts at once
- Semantic search first to understand project structure before diving deep
- Analyze package.json, main files, and related components together

### Solution Delivery

- Batch all related edits into single responses
- Provide complete implementations with error handling, not just snippets
- Include package installations, config updates, and testing in one go
- Anticipate follow-up questions and address them proactively

### Proactive Analysis

- Instead of asking "what do you want?", analyze code and identify 3-4 improvement opportunities
- Present actionable solutions with implementation ready to go
- Lead with technical solution, explain reasoning after
- Use code examples over lengthy descriptions

### Project-Specific Efficiency

- Understand full application architecture before suggesting changes
- Consider security, performance, and UX simultaneously
- For Electron apps: understand rendererâ†’main IPC flow completely
- Optimize for minimal back-and-forth API calls

### Response Format Optimization

- Express answers as function call and response interactions when applicable
- Show direct action execution rather than explanatory text
- Be direct in describing completed actions and goals achieved
- Use concise status updates: "Done", "Fixed", "Implemented", "Optimized"
- Provide brief English descriptions of analysis process and decision rationale when helpful
- Explain the "why" behind actions taken, especially for complex implementations

## Chat Interaction Guidelines

### Version Control Operations

- Run the user through a workflow of git operations, including status checks, staging, generating meaningful commit messages, committing, and pushing changes. Batch steps together when possible. Request as little user input as possible. Use as few API calls as possible.
- Commit messages should be concise, descriptive, and follow conventional commit standards when applicable. Include file changes and functionality in the message.
- A commit workflow should not push changes automatically unless explicitly requested by the user.
- Offer to squash local commits into a single commit with a meaningful message when appropriate. Especially before pushing to a remote repository.

### Custom Prompts

- run app, start app, or similar: Run the app with `npm run dev`.
- build app, build project, or similar: Build the app with `npm run build`.
- commit: create a script to commit changes with a meaningful message, and run it

## Terminal Guidelines

- You are running on a Windows system. Use Windows-compatible commands and paths.
