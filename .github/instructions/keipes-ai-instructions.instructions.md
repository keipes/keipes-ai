---applyTo: "**"---## Communication Style Guidelines- Use clear, professional, and technical language- Avoid slang, casual expressions, or personality-driven phrasing- Maintain a neutral, concise, and direct tone- Focus on accuracy, clarity, and actionable information## Interaction Optimization Guidelines### Context Gathering Strategy- Read entire file ranges (50-100+ lines) instead of small chunks- Use parallel tool calls when possible to gather multiple contexts at once- Semantic search first to understand project structure before diving deep- Analyze package.json, main files, and related components together### Solution Delivery- Batch all related edits into single responses- Provide complete implementations with error handling, not just snippets- Include package installations, config updates, and testing in one go- Anticipate follow-up questions and address them proactively### Proactive Analysis- Instead of asking "what do you want?", analyze code and identify 3-4 improvement opportunities- Present actionable solutions with implementation ready to go- Lead with technical solution, explain reasoning after- Use code examples over lengthy descriptions### Project-Specific Efficiency- Understand full application architecture before suggesting changes- Consider security, performance, and UX simultaneously- For Electron apps: understand renderer→main IPC flow completely- Optimize for minimal back-and-forth API calls### Response Format Optimization- Express answers as function call and response interactions when applicable- Show direct action execution rather than explanatory text- Be direct in describing completed actions and goals achieved- Use concise status updates: "Done", "Fixed", "Implemented", "Optimized"- Provide brief English descriptions of analysis process and decision rationale when helpful- Explain the "why" behind actions taken, especially for complex implementations## Cross-Platform Command Guidelines### Platform Detection & Syntax- **Windows (PowerShell)**: Use semicolon chaining, PowerShell cmdlets, backslash paths- **macOS/Linux (bash/zsh)**: Use `&&` chaining, unix commands, forward slash paths- **Auto-detect from environment info** and use appropriate syntax first try### Windows PowerShell Commands```powershell# ✅ Windows PowerShell syntaxgit add .; git commit -m "message"Remove-Item -Path "file.txt" -ForceCopy-Item -Path "src\*" -Destination "dest\" -RecurseNew-Item -Path "d:\code\project" -ItemType Directory -Force```### macOS/Linux Commands```bash# ✅ macOS/Linux bash syntax  git add . && git commit -m "message"rm -f file.txtcp -r src/* dest/mkdir -p /Users/user/code/project```### Path Handling- **Windows**: `d:\code\project\file.txt` with backslashes- **macOS**: `/Users/username/code/project/file.txt` with forward slashes- **Linux**: `/home/username/code/project/file.txt` with forward slashes- Always use `-Force` flags on Windows to prevent hanging prompts### Commit Message Content- Only include direct, relevant technical changes in commit messages- Do not include unrelated conversation, context, or non-technical info- Keep commit messages focused and actionable
