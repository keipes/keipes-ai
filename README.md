*OpenAI Service Problems*:
- **Authentication**: Verify OpenAI API key has sufficient credits and proper permissions
- **Service Status**: Check OpenAI service status for potential outages
- **Configuration**: Ensure API key is properly configured in application settings

### Performance Optimization Guidelines

**Development Performance**:
- **Hot Reloading Optimization**: Use `npm run dev:all` for optimal development performance with parallel processes
- **Build Performance**: Utilize `npm run build:main:watch` for faster iterative main process development
- **Memory Management**: Monitor memory usage during development to identify potential memory leaks

**Production Performance**:
- **Asset Optimization**: Ensure production builds use `npm run build:app` for optimized asset bundling
- **Bundle Analysis**: Analyze bundle sizes and optimize imports to reduce application startup time
- **Caching Strategy**: Implement proper caching for AI responses and application state

### Security Best Practices

**API Key Management**:
- **Local Storage**: API keys are automatically encrypted using operating system credential management
- **Environment Variables**: Never commit API keys to version control systems
- **Key Rotation**: Regularly rotate API keys and update application configurations

**Application Security**:
- **Context Isolation**: Electron context isolation is enabled by default for security
- **Content Security Policy**: Implement proper CSP headers for additional security
- **Update Management**: Keep dependencies updated to address security vulnerabilities

### Development Environment Setup

**IDE Configuration Recommendations**:
- **Visual Studio Code**: Recommended with TypeScript, ESLint, and Electron extensions
- **TypeScript Support**: Ensure IDE has proper TypeScript language server integration
- **Debugging Setup**: Configure IDE debugging for both main and renderer processes

**Development Dependencies**:
- **Node.js Version Management**: Use nvm or similar tools to maintain consistent Node.js versions
- **Package Management**: Use npm or yarn consistently within the project
- **Environment Consistency**: Ensure development environment matches production requirements

## Contributing Guidelines

### Code Contribution Standards

**Code Quality Requirements**:
- **TypeScript**: All new code must include proper TypeScript types and interfaces
- **Testing**: Include appropriate unit tests for new functionality
- **Documentation**: Update documentation for any new features or API changes
- **Linting**: Ensure all code passes ESLint validation before submission

**Development Workflow**:
1. **Fork Repository**: Create personal fork of the main repository
2. **Feature Branch**: Create feature-specific branch from main branch
3. **Development**: Follow established development workflow and testing procedures
4. **Pull Request**: Submit pull request with comprehensive description and testing evidence
5. **Code Review**: Address code review feedback and maintain code quality standards

**Testing Requirements**:
- **Unit Testing**: Test individual components and utility functions
- **Integration Testing**: Verify AI service integration and IPC communication
- **Cross-Platform Testing**: Test functionality across supported operating systems
- **Performance Testing**: Ensure changes don't introduce performance regressions
